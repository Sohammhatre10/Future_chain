The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped about 0.4%, or 150 points. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down about 0.4%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped 0.8%, both paring losses of more than 1% earlier Tuesday. Worries about US banks were revived after Moody’s downgraded 10 small and midsize institutions, which came with a warning it could lower credit ratings for some of the nation’s biggest lenders. It flagged risks in their commercial real estate portfolios, a reminder that stresses in the sector persist after the banking crisis earlier this year. In Europe, bank stocks tumbled after the Italian government said it will put a 40% windfall tax on lenders’ profits, raising fears that other countries could do the same. Optimism about stocks also took a hit Tuesday when data showed a slump in Chinese imports and exports in July that was far worse than expected. Demand is weak, dimming the prospects for a rebound in the world’s second-biggest economy. Those discouraging economic signs come as investors wait for the release of the July inflation report on Thursday, looking for a steer on whether the Federal Reserve will put its interest rate hikes on pause again. Meanwhile, another batch of earnings reports is rolling in and could shed more light on how corporate America is faring. Results from UPS (UPS), Eli Lilly (LLY), Restaurant Brands (QSR), and Fox Corp (FOXA) are among the highlights.

              "  'Proof of State is the Wednesday edition of Fortune Crypto where Leo Schwartz delivers insider insights on policy and regulation. After months of collapses, hacks, and frauds, the crypto industry has had a relatively boring start to the summer, with the news cycle dominated by legislative markups and everyone’s favorite financial instruments, ETFs. While they may not be as rousing as innovations like liquidity pools and perps, ETFs represent crypto’s best chance to go mainstream, at least in the world of traditional finance, through their ability to provide investors a familiar route to portfolio exposure. Thanks to Grayscale’s legal battle with the SEC, which is set to be decided any week now, spot Bitcoin ETFs have received the lion’s share of attention in recent weeks, especially as major firms like BlackRock and Cathie Wood’s ARK seem poised for approval. A new entrant, however, is picking up steam: Ether futures ETFs, which have seen a spate of applicants since late July. As a refresher, the SEC has only approved Bitcoin futures ETFs so far, which tracks the cryptocurrency’s price through futures contracts on CFTC-regulated exchanges. When companies, including Grayscale, filed for a similar futures ETF for Ether last May, they were asked by the SEC to withdraw their applications, which they did. The past week has seen a half-dozen companies re-file, kicked off by Volatility Shares and followed by other firms including Grayscale, BitWise, ProShares, and VanEck. So what’s behind the influx? Last week, Blockworks reported that the SEC indicated its “readiness” to consider Ether futures ETFs. I confirmed this with two of the companies, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. One said it got a call from SEC staff saying the agency was ready to “publicly review” the application, spurring them to re-file. The company said it wouldn’t have done so without the call. The general counsel for another project told me that SEC staff had previously told them in May that Ether was a little too young for a futures ETF, and that Bitcoin futures had more of a track record before its ETF product was approved.

Evans, Layah Heilpern, George Tung and \"BitBoy Crypto.\" Take “The Apprentice,” add a dash of “Shark Tank” and toss in 16 crypto enthusiasts competing for a six-figure prize package and you’ve got “The Next Crypto Gem,” a new competition reality show that will make its debut in September. The show will pit contestants against one another in challenges to win a prize package estimated to be worth $150,000. It will feature well-known crypto influencers Brian D. Evans, Layah Heilpern and George Tung as judges as well as guest stars, including original “Shark Tank” cast member Kevin Harrington and infamous crypto personality YouTuber Ben Armstrong, who is better known as “BitBoy Crypto.” Executive Producer Jett Tang said the heart of the show is to bring crypto to a “mainstream audience for the first time. The teamwork, the rivalry, the larger-than-life characters and the out-the-box ideas.” One important aspect of the show, Tang told CoinDesk, “is to bring in mainstream adoption and to really show crypto, make crypto interesting and entertaining.” Tang shared that the first episode’s challenge involves people who were “the least likely to understand crypto and the most unfriendly to crypto.” The contestants are then broken into four teams that need to prove they can explain the basics of blockchain to the “no coiners” to win the challenge. The education element continues throughout each of the six weeks of challenges, with what Tang called “The Big Short” moments throughout where the judges break in to explain a key crypto term or concept. While the educational component is important, the show’s focus is on capturing crypto culture and the eclectic characters found in the industry. That is why some of the more controversial crypto figures came to be involved with the show, such as \"BitBoy Crypto,\" who has faced backlash for promoting certain crypto projects on his popular YouTube channel, most notably for hyping now-bankrupt lender Celsius Network.

McNeil reveals that the ETF has already attracted $3 million of investment in less than a month, indicating strong demand.

The interview also touched on the significance of BlackRock\\'s filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US.

              "  \"TORONTO, Aug. 9, 2023 /CNW/ -\\xa0Bitget, the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange, has released the results of research entailing the copy and social trading phenomenon on its platform. The data reveals that Generation Z users account for 44% of all copy trading users, exhibiting the highest interest in this trading strategy whilst older crypto traders also leverage copy trading to gain market trends and insights. The research conducted by Bitget took into account a pool of active crypto traders who engaged in trading operations throughout the year. In the first half of 2023, over 109,000 followers experienced profitable returns from applying copy trading techniques, resulting in more than 74 million in cumulative profits in USDT terms. Among the users who employed copy strategies for futures trading in this period, an impressive 93% of them made profits. Bitcoin proved to be the most common asset traded via copy trading, accounting for 52%, followed by ETH at 44%. Geographically, Bitget's copy traders are primarily located in Western Europe, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. Among these regions, Western Europe accounts for the largest share with 31% of all copy trading users, followed closely by East Asia at 26%, and Southeast Asia at 19%. Although African users account for a small proportion, they exhibit the highest levels of interest due to the emerging nature of crypto markets in Africa, where users are often less experienced and more inclined to use copy trading as a starting point. When it comes to demographics, the copy trading feature is especially popular among Gen Z users, who increasingly turn to social media for financial information over traditional media, their friends and family. This group of crypto enthusiasts (below the age of 25) accounts for 44% of all copy traders on the platform, followed by the 25-35 age group at 32%. Those aged 35-55 account for 17% of users, while individuals over 55 make up 7%. It is worth noting that, although there are fewer older copy traders, their interest in copy trading is high. The data shows that 72% of traders under 25 indicated an interest in Bitget's copy\",\n",

Bitcoin rose 2.3% in the past 24 hours to close to $30,000 as investors wait for July's Consumer Price Index, a gauge of inflation in the U.S., which is scheduled to be released on Thursday. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to come in at 0.4%, far below the pace seen a year ago. Lower inflation should mean the Federal Reserve will be less likely to raise rates. Oliver Rust, head of product at independent inflation data aggregator Truflation, predicts that the inflation numbers will show that CPI spiked from 3% to 3.4% in July. “Over the past three months, the rapid decline in inflation allowed consumers to regain their purchasing power, with wages growing at a faster rate than prices. This has resulted in the resurgence of rampant consumer spending, pushing up prices in the all-important food category,” Rust wrote in a morning note. The Fed is starting a new program for overseeing banks’ crypto activity, and it further clarified its requirement that the lenders under its authority get approval before engaging in digital-assets activities. The move announced Tuesday doesn’t change any rules for crypto banking. Rather, it just defines how the central bank intends to handle oversight, putting dealings with the crypto sector under the new “novel activities supervision program” in which the Fed’s specialized experts in digital assets will work alongside the regulator’s regular supervisors. The Fed also issued a fuller explanation for how the banks it supervises need to get preapprovals for engaging with stablecoins. An institution that’s “issuing, holding or transacting in dollar tokens to facilitate payments” needs to prove to the supervisors beforehand that it can do so in a “safe and sound manner” and needs the Fed to formally sign off.

              "  'By Elena Fabrichnaya MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia will begin piloting its digital rouble with consumers on Aug. 15 after a lengthy testing phase with banks, the central bank said on Wednesday, as Moscow looks to widen the scope of its cross-border payments. Russia, like many countries, has been developing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) - digital tokens issued by central banks - over the last couple of years in a bid to modernise its financial system and head off cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Eleven countries, including a number in the Caribbean, and Nigeria, have already CBDCs, according to research by the U.S.-based Atlantic Council think tank, while many more, including China, are engaged in large-scale pilot testing. \"We expect to test operations with real customers,\" the central bank\\'s First Deputy Governor Olga Skorobogatova said on Wednesday. The pilot test will include opening digital wallets, making purchases with digital roubles and transfers between around 600 customers and 30 companies from 11 cities. The scheme will eventually enable Russia to develop cross-border payments with other countries that issue digital currencies, Skorobogatova said. Moscow has faced a pressing need to develop its payments infrastructure since wide-ranging western sanctions in opposition to its actions in Ukraine blocked Russia from large swathes of the global financial system. The digital rouble is scheduled to be widely introduced in 2025. Next year, the central bank will expand the list of participants, with another 19 banks keen to join the pilot, Skorobogatova said.

With over 69% of Bitcoin supply inactive for over a year, long-term investors remain bullish on the world’s first cryptocurrency, industry experts told Forkast. See related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin plunges under US$30,000 amid market turbulence. Is US$27,000 next?\\xa0 Bitcoin was little changed during afternoon trading in Asia, trading at US$29,779 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong after it fell below the US$30,000 support level on July 24. “Recent data reveals that a staggering 69.2% of the total Bitcoin supply has remained untouched for over a year. This trend showcases a robust belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value, even amidst the notorious downturns that have characterized the cryptocurrency market over the past year,” according to a Bitfinex research report, shared with Forkast. “With a significant chunk of Bitcoin’s supply remaining inactive, the available supply in the market diminishes. This inherent scarcity, juxtaposed with burgeoning demand, has the potential to drive prices upward. The unwavering faith in Bitcoin paints a bullish picture for the cryptocurrency’s future.” Lifted by Bitcoin, Ether rose 0.26% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,860 from US$1,869 earlier today. Solana’s SOL token was the day’s biggest winner in the top 10, gaining 5.83% in the past 24 hours to US$24.60, followed by Polygon’s Matic, up 3.64% to US$0.6931. Total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 1.86% to US$1.18 trillion while market volume increased 24.90% to US$40.37 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.

              "  'Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s attorneys argued on Monday that the billionaire’s legal battle with a group of disgruntled Dogecoin investors has dragged on for too long. Musk’s counsel asked for the plaintiff’s revised complaint to be dismissed, according to a filing submitted in a New York federal court. In a letter supporting the dismissal, Musk lawyer Alex Shapiro skewered the lawsuit’s latest complaint submitted on behalf of Dogecoin investors. “Enough is enough,” Shapiro wrote. “This action is yet another example of counsel’s abusive and belligerent litigation tactics.” Evan Spencer, the lead attorney in the class-action lawsuit against Musk, amended the lawsuit’s complaint for a third time in June, tacking on additional allegations. Elon Musk, Tesla and SpaceX Hit With $258 Billion Dogecoin Lawsuit The lawsuit, which initially sought $258 billion in damages when filed last June, accuses Musk of “a deliberate course of carnival barking, market manipulation, and insider trading” when it comes to one of crypto’s most iconic meme coins. Musk’s enthusiasm for Dogecoin has been well-documented over the years since his initial Tweet that “Dogecoin may be [his] fav cryptocurrency” in April 2019, and it’s only continued since his acquisition of Twitter last year. The Tesla CEO’s latest high-profile moment involving Dogecoin took place around (but not on) April Fools Day when Twitter’s logo was temporarily replaced with Dogecoin’s Shiba Inu mascot. In the amended complaint, Spenser notes the switch took place shortly after Musk’s counsel sought to dismiss the lawsuit in March and led Dogecoin to rally 30%.  Dogecoin Surges 20% as Doge Replaces Bird Logo on Twitter In 2021, Dogecoin pumped to dizzying heights ahead of Musk’s appearance on NBC’s Saturday Night Live only for Dogecoin to buckle after he called it a hustle on the late-night comedy show. Still, Musk’s counsel says any Dogecoin “cheerleading” their client has done over the years amounts to “quintessential, inactionable puffery.” “There is nothing unlawful about tweeting words of support for, or funny pictures about, a cryptocurrency,” Musk’s counsel wrote in Monday’s motion, deriding the amended complaint as “fanciful, meandering, and often incomprehensible.” Musk’s lawyers stated the lawsuit’s',\n",

              "  \"Stockholm, August 9th, 2023 - Virtune, a Swedish regulated digital asset manager in Sweden is launching a new innovative staking ETP on Nasdaq Stockholm, the largest stock exchange in the Nordic region. Today, Virtune is announcing the introduction of Virtune Staked Ethereum ETP SEK, providing exposure to Ethereum combined with the benefits of staking.  The ETP which is 100% physically backed and fully collateralized is denominated in SEK for the Swedish audience and is available on Avanza and Nordnet. By including staking, this ETP provides investors with up to 5% in additional annual return on their ETP Ethereum investment.  Ethereum is currently the second largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of about $219 billion and the world's leading smart contract platform which can revolutionize the way we interact with technology and finance. With its robust ecosystem, Ethereum enables developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) that can reshape industries, eliminate middlemen, and bring greater transparency and efficiency to global systems. By engaging in Ethereum staking, you actively support the blockchain network and promote its decentralized nature.  This product caters to institutional investors as well as retail investors, serving the many people who support Ethereum already to improve and enhance their Ethereum investment even further. Virtune uses non-custodial staking meaning that the assets are being staked directly from cold storage, therefore there is no need to transfer the asset to any third party which is associated with risk.  Key Information about the product: 1:1 exposure to Ethereum combined with staking providing up to 5% additional annual return 100% physically backed Non-custodial staking 1.40% annual management fee Virtune Staked Ethereum ETP SEK: Full name: Virtune Staked Ethereum ETP SEK Short name: Virtune Staked Ethereum SEK Trading currency: SEK First day of trading: Wednesday 9th of August Ticker: VIRSETHS ISIN: SE0020541639 Christopher Kock, CEO of Virtune:\\xa0“We are very happy to introduce a 100% physically backed Ethereum product integrated with staking.

              "  \"Ethereum-based debt capital marketplace Maple Finance plans to open up its Cash Management pool to accredited American investors via a Regulation D exemption. The pool launched last April to offer qualified investors on-chain exposure to U.S. Treasury yields while complying with risk and accounting requirements. A Regulation D exemption means the offering need not be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but is restricted to accredited U.S. investors. The offering opens access to Maple’s Cash Management pool to high net-worth individuals, crypto funds, DAOs, Web3 start-ups and other eligible investors. Maple’s Cash Management pool showed strong growth in July, surpassing $21.5M in total value locked, and paid approximately 4.7% to lenders after fees. The project’s MPL token has more than doubled since the start of the year. Although it remains unavailable to retail investors, the offering from Maple represents a step towards compliant on-chain offerings by way of existing legal frameworks such as Regulation D, according to Maple cofounder and CEO Sidney Powell. “In future, we hope that there would be a regulatory framework where it can be offered to everyone,” Powell told The Defiant. Maple’s investment vehicle structure is unique compared to most crypto lending platforms that treat depositors like limited partners in a pooled investment vehicle. “Maple's structure is done more as a loan. So you lend to the delegate who's underwriting the collateralized loans or the loans that are collateralized with T bills. And so we've effectively done… a loan backed by another loan,” said Powell. Maple is able to move faster with the lightweight approach, according to Powell, as onboarding processes become less cumbersome without “200 pages of documents that they need to go through to access the product.” The company can also get people in and out of a pool more quickly, offering interest that begins accruing at the time of deposit and next-day redemptions, where other platforms might take as long as 48 hours, said Powell. Demand from U.S. investors for earning interest on stablecoins is growing, and according to Powell, they are willing to pay a premium for an enhanced user\",\n",
              "  \"Coinbase expects to get more revenue from decentralized applications or “dapps” that build atop Base than from the blockchain itself. Coinbase has participated in discussions among developers over future upgrades for the Ethereum blockchain. Coinbase aims to provide a “trusted interface, curated experiences” to people who previously have not spent a lot of time working with blockchains. Coinbase, the big publicly traded U.S. crypto exchange, is preparing for the launch of its new Base blockchain on Wednesday, expected around noon ET (9 am Pacific time). The new network, technically a “layer 2” blockchain built atop Ethereum, is expected to immediately vault into the top ranks of rival projects. Even prior to its official public debut, there was already $133 million of deposits locked into apps and protocols on the new Base network, according to the crypto analysis firm L2Beat. That amount of “total value locked” or TVL – a common metric for evaluating blockchains and protocols – is enough to rank Base as the fifth-biggest layer-2 blockchain. On Tuesday, CoinDesk had a zoom conversation with Jesse Pollak, creator of Base and head of protocols at Coinbase, about the new blockchain's strategy, revenue potential and regulatory considerations. A key point that Pollak emphasized: No publicly traded company has ever launched its own blockchain, so “there’s no playbook” for how to go about it. The following Q&A has been edited for clarity and brevity. CoinDesk: What does Coinbase get out of this initiative? Pollak: Coinbase was started in 2012, before Ethereum, before smart contracts. It was really just a place to buy and sell bitcoin. And then over the last decade, it's expanded, you know, adding more currencies, made it so you couldn’t just buy and sell, you could also save, you could stake, you borrow, you could lend. I think the kind of guiding North Star for Coinbase has been like, How do we enable people to safely and easily do things with crypto? That's it. And I think historically that the aperture of what people can do with crypto has been relatively limited, right? It's been mostly speculation, and mostly\",\n",
              "  'London, United Kingdom --News Direct-- Chainwire Ramp Network, a financial technology company building payment rails connecting crypto to the global financial system has added support for Base, the Coinbase-developed layer2 network. The integration means that Ramp users can convert Base-native ETH and USDC to crypto on other chains as well as into fiat currency. Designed to support fast and low-cost transactions, Base is an Ethereum L2 that’s built using Optimism’s rollup technology. In late July the network opened its mainnet to developers, followed by an official launch on August 9. Base has already witnessed an influx of users seeking to access the new tokens and DeFi primitives emerging on the layer2 chain. Ramp’s decision to add support for Base creates a valuable pipeline for entering and exiting the Base ecosystem, making it easier for users to direct digital assets to where they’re needed. “Coinbase’s fresh blockchain, Base, was initially introduced to developers in February. Nevertheless, its formal public debut is today. In alignment with our steadfast commitment to the ecosystem’s Layer 2 solutions, Ramp will proudly support Base right from its inception, enabling transactions with ETH and USDC from day one. Exciting times ahead!” stated Szymon Sypniewicz, CEO of Ramp. Developing reliable on- and off-ramps is critical to bootstrapping emerging crypto networks. Ramp’s integration of Base arrives at a crucial time for the nascent chain, giving users the confidence to explore the L2 confidence that they can withdraw funds whenever they like. The Ramp platform now supports the conversion of ETH and USDC on Base into dozens of other crypto assets including BTC, stablecoins, and ETH on other chains. In addition, users can convert Base assets directly into fiat currency. Ramp can also be used to deposit funds onto Base, allowing users to start exploring its growing ecosystem in minutes. In addition to directly benefiting users of the Coinbase-supported chain, Ramp’s integration of Base will aid third-party developers. It will empower them to create applications that integrate Ramp’s fiat-crypto service. This will accelerate the creation of novel apps that capitalize on the powerful network effects afforded by the new layer2.',\n",

Coca-Cola and popular DAOs like Friends With Benefits and Nouns are participating in different activations. Let’s face it: non-fungible tokens (NFTs) aren’t having a hot girl summer. Perhaps “Onchain Summer,” crypto exchange Coinbase’s (COIN) event to celebrate the launch of its native Base network, can help bolster the tokens’ trading volume. Onchain Summer, which kicked off today in celebration of Base’s mainnet launch, is a series of Web3 activations across art, gaming and music. Through the end of August, over 50 brands, including Coca-Cola, Friends With Benefits, a social decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), and NFT creator platform Zora will host NFT mints on Base network. In addition to branded NFT offerings, Coinbase is collaborating with Prop House, an incubator linked to NFT project Nouns DAO, to give out over 100 ETH, or $186,000, in grants for developers building on Base. They’re also encouraging developers to enroll in the ETH Global Superhack, an upcoming hackathon that will offer $175,000 in rewards. To bolster community engagement around Base, Coinbase is encouraging users to bridge their ether to Base in order to mint a free NFT to commemorate the launch of the Base mainnet. According to data from Etherscan, over 125,000 individuals have minted over 30 million free NFTs so far. In a year where NFT trading volume has fallen almost 50% since January, Web3 projects are struggling to scale. Jesse Pollak, Protocols Lead at Coinbase, told CoinDesk that Onchain Summer aims to showcase how NFTs can be leveraged as a technology rather than just a speculative asset. “We wanted to give people a reason to be on-chain this summer and set up their first wallet and experience this future,” said Pollak. Onchain Summer’s first week will feature daily mints, starting with Friends With Benefits, who will issue an NFT on Thursday designed by artist Deekay Kwon alongside pseudonymous NFT collector Cozomo de Medici. On Saturday, Coca-Cola will open a mint of digital artworks from the Masterpiece collection, with works from artists Aket, Fatma Ramadan and\",\n",

With over 69% of Bitcoin supply inactive for over a year, long-term investors remain bullish on the world’s first cryptocurrency, industry experts told Forkast. See related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin plunges under US$30,000 amid market turbulence. Is US$27,000 next?\\xa0 Bitcoin was little changed during afternoon trading in Asia, trading at US$29,779 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong after it fell below the US$30,000 support level on July 24. “Recent data reveals that a staggering 69.2% of the total Bitcoin supply has remained untouched for over a year. This trend showcases a robust belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value, even amidst the notorious downturns that have characterized the cryptocurrency market over the past year,” according to a Bitfinex research report, shared with Forkast. “With a significant chunk of Bitcoin’s supply remaining inactive, the available supply in the market diminishes. This inherent scarcity, juxtaposed with burgeoning demand, has the potential to drive prices upward. The unwavering faith in Bitcoin paints a bullish picture for the cryptocurrency’s future.” Lifted by Bitcoin, Ether rose 0.26% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,860 from US$1,869 earlier today. Solana’s SOL token was the day’s biggest winner in the top 10, gaining 5.83% in the past 24 hours to US$24.60, followed by Polygon’s Matic, up 3.64% to US$0.6931. Total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 1.86% to US$1.18 trillion while market volume increased 24.90% to US$40.37 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Just announced last week, the Animoca-backed player-versus-player fighter will feature custom NFT-assembled mechs battling it out for a spot on the leaderboard for on-chain rewards. There may be some profits here for degens, with tons of mech parts to trade and even the ability to sell your completed mech skins. Throw in the fact that Yuga Labs will be officially partnered with Wreck League in season one with Bored Ape Yacht Club and Koda-themed mechs, and it seems that we’re looking at a real juggernaut of an NFT game. The NFT ecosystem has never been more ready for play-to-earn gaming, even if the space hopes to move away from that term.

Today’s NFT ecosystem couldn’t be more the opposite, and a tremendously down market has instead conditioned traders for lower profit or maybe even no expectations for gains. Be honest, anon, when was the last time you saw some profits? Sellers have seen only a small handful of days in the profit since March, and we’re now on steep monthly decline since May. If traders can’t find profits in established NFT projects, or new mints, they will need to find a new type of NFT to turn their attention to. Gaming NFTs, you’re on deck. Affordable NFTs are the future of NFTs, and it’s not just DMarket and Gods Unchained giving us a glimpse of this new meta. DraftKings and Sorare, with their fantasy sports NFTs, show that with high volume and low priced NFTs are the sweet spot for NFTs. Give us 10 cents here, a few dollars there, and occasionally a home run, and we’ll be hooked for the long haul. Those small sales are nothing to snicker at too.

              "  'The CoinDesk Market Index of 183 assets – a broad-based indicator of crypto market sentiment – is down 1.4% for the last week. But that is just a blip in its 60.1% growth year to date. Let’s take a look at the bigger picture of the top-10 and bottom-10 assets based on their performance month on month. Culture and entertainment assets and currencies predominated the leaders. Small gaming and metaverse protocols including Yield Guild Games (YGG), a global community that bands gamers together to play, and HighStreet (HIGH), a decentralized metaverse and massively multiplayer online role-playing game, as well as LivePeer (LPT), a decentralized video streaming network protocol, made a huge impression in the top 10 leaderboard. But their impact overall was not so large. As these are all small players, the culture and entertainment sector, which is market-cap weighted, was pretty flat month on month (down 0.4%). The spectacular up and down of Yield Guild Games is a story still in progress. On Aug. 3, the guild announced the launch of its fourth audience-building campaign that features numerous quests and rewards. The token rose a dizzying 600% over the next four days, but on Aug. 7 began to plummet as rumors that the guild’s initial backers were using the opportunity to take their money out. “It appears to be a pump and dump,” said CoinDesk Indices Data Analyst Reilly Decker. Stellar (XLM), XRP (XRP) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) were the biggest currency leaders over the last week. Stellar is building on a research report it released in July that supports the narrative that XLM is one of the most well-connected and integrated USDC cash off-ramps. XRP is still benefiting from a U.S. judge’s ruling last month that the sale of XRP tokens on exchanges do not constitute investment contracts (and therefore are not covered by securities laws). Just this month, Shiba Inu (SHIB) announced it would tie digital identity services across all of its platforms, another sign of its effort to distance itself from its meme coin origins and become a serious DeFi protocol.

              "  'Since the start of the year, I’ve been pre-occupied by a question I can’t seem to get decent answers to. I’ve asked it at conferences, on live panels, on podcasts, and to smart friends over zoom. It’s pretty simple: “If you couldn’t get rich off of it, what currently existing products in crypto would significant numbers of people still use?” Let me break that down. I use Uber, Google Docs, Twitter, Gmail, Spotify, Netflix, PayPal, Calendly, Slack and\\xa0 iTunes at least once a week, if not every day. And in the case of Gmail and Twitter (I refuse to call it X), I use them pretty much every hour. I use all of these products without any expectation of becoming a millionaire. Shiv Malik is the founder of Pool Data and a former investigative journalist. Some of these apps I love. Others not so much: iTunes sucks. I give most of them money. Or I even, as with Uber, Deliveroo and Paypal, transact with third party services through them. But again, even though I use them, I don’t expect to get rich. The utility is enough. So what about Web3? I’ve been in the space since late-2016. Fascinated by the socio-economic possibilities of smart contracts, I started by purchasing some ETH for $9 on Coinbase. I then rapidly degened into 10x margin trading XRP on Poloniex. I’ve\\xa0 worked for two Web3 companies and founded my own, been to a dozen crypto conferences on four continents, and I once had to hide Gavin Wood in my hotel bathtub. I’m no crypto hater.

But I use all of these products to move and trade tokens. And I trade tokens so I can increase my wealth. (Though that often doesn’t workout for me). So what, in Web3, would I and say, another five million daily active users, just use? For the utility. And not to make a fast buck. I’ve been given lots of answers. Most all of them invariably',\n",

              "  \"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening: Prices: Regulatory clarity is required for bitcoin to push past $30,000. Insights: Where is the utility in Web3? Bitcoin (BTC) is beginning the Asia trading day at $29,786, up 2% on-day, while ether (ETH) is trading at $1,855, up 1.3%. Bitcoin’s volatility continues to be at a record low, Vivien Fang, head of trading products at Bybit, said in a note to CoinDesk, suggesting an eventual rebound. “Our attention is on catalysts toward year-end, potentially linked to ETF narratives or industry-transforming events,” she said. “The alignment between speculative strategies and these kinds of pivotal events could combine to form significant tailwinds for the crypto market.” The 30k mark is a critical threshold, with consensus indicating 40k as the next significant level, Fang explained. However, there remains a high potential for a volatility surge due to macro-related downside events that could unexpectedly impact the market. Despite bitcoin’s low volatility, it’s still outperformed crypto hedge funds, according to a report from 21e6 Capital. “It is plain to see that a simple buy-and-hold investment into bitcoin would have outperformed all of these fund baskets. Bitcoin added about 80% in value by the half of the year,” 21e6 Capital due diligence manager Jan Spörer and sales and marketing head Maximilian Bruckner wrote in the report. “In previous bull runs, crypto hedge funds were frequently able to significantly outperform the bitcoin benchmark.” Data from CryptoRank.io shows that the price of bitcoin and the amount of money invested in crypto startups have historically been correlated, their analyst team wrote in a note to CoinDesk. In 2022, both were on the decline. However, despite the significant growth of bitcoin in 2023, the monthly amount raised is low compared to 2021-2022. The question continues to be: what will cause the next breakout? And what if it's not the long-awaited bitcoin ETF? Crypto Market Leaders and Laggards: The Biggest Movers of the Week: Stellar, XRP and Shiba Inu were notable winners from the last week, while Curve Finance and Augur struggled. The market is down overall, according to CoinDesk Market Index, but only marginally\",\n",
              "  'Bitcoin gets all the headlines when people talk about cryptocurrencies, but there are literally thousands of other options when it comes to these digital currencies. In fact, cryptos that aren’t Bitcoin are usually considered an “also ran” – what are called “altcoins,” or alternatives to Bitcoin. While Bitcoin may have been the first major cryptocurrency to hit the market – it debuted in 2009 – many others have become highly popular, even if not quite as large as the original. Here are the largest cryptocurrencies by the total dollar value of the coins in existence, that is, the market capitalization, or market cap. (Data is from CoinMarketCap.com, as of August 9, 2023.) Price: $29,717 Market cap: $578 billion As the harbinger of the cryptocurrency era, Bitcoin is still the coin people generally reference when they talk about digital currency. Its mysterious creator — allegedly Satoshi Nakamoto — debuted the currency in 2009 and it’s been on a roller-coaster ride since then. However, it wasn’t until 2017 that the cryptocurrency broke into popular consciousness. Price: $1,852 Market cap: $223 billion Ethereum — the name for the cryptocurrency platform — is the second name you’re most likely to recognize in the crypto space. The system allows you to use ether (the currency) to perform a number of functions, but the smart contract aspect of Ethereum helps make it a popular currency. Price: $1.00 Market cap: $83 billion Tether’s price is anchored at $1 per coin. That’s because it is what’s called a stablecoin. Stablecoins are tied to the value of a specific asset, in Tether’s case, the U.S. Dollar. Tether often acts as a medium when traders move from one cryptocurrency to another. Rather than move back to dollars, they use Tether. However, some people are concerned that Tether isn’t safely backed by dollars held in reserve but instead uses a short-term form of unsecured debt. Price: $244.83 Market cap: $38 billion BNB is the cryptocurrency issued by Binance, among the largest crypto exchanges in the world. While originally created as a token to pay for discounted trades, Binance Coin can now',\n",
