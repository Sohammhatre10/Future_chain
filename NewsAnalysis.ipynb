Today, Virtune is announcing the introduction of Virtune Staked Ethereum ETP SEK, providing exposure to Ethereum combined with the benefits of staking.  The ETP which is 100% physically backed and fully collateralized is denominated in SEK for the Swedish audience and is available on Avanza and Nordnet. By including staking, this ETP provides investors with up to 5% in additional annual return on their ETP Ethereum investment.  Ethereum is currently the second largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of about $219 billion and the world's leading smart contract platform which can revolutionize the way we interact with technology and finance. With its robust ecosystem, Ethereum enables developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) that can reshape industries, eliminate middlemen, and bring greater transparency and efficiency to global systems. By engaging in Ethereum staking, you actively support the blockchain network and promote its decentralized nature.  This product caters to institutional investors as well as retail investors, serving the many people who support Ethereum already to improve and enhance their Ethereum investment even further. Virtune uses non-custodial staking meaning that the assets are being staked directly from cold storage, therefore there is no need to transfer the asset to any third party which is associated with risk.  Key Information about the product: 1:1 exposure to Ethereum combined with staking providing up to 5% additional annual return 100% physically backed Non-custodial staking 1.40% annual management fee Virtune Staked Ethereum ETP SEK: Full name: Virtune Staked Ethereum ETP SEK Short name: Virtune Staked Ethereum SEK Trading currency: SEK First day of trading: Wednesday 9th of August Ticker: VIRSETHS ISIN: SE0020541639 Christopher Kock, CEO of Virtune:\\xa0“We are very happy to introduce a 100% physically backed Ethereum product integrated with staking. In our view, this represents the most advantageous approach to gain exposure to Ethereum. There is a growing demand for Ethereum investment alternatives in the Nordics and by introducing this\",\n",
              "  \"Coinbase expects to get more revenue from decentralized applications or “dapps” that build atop Base than from the blockchain itself. Coinbase has participated in discussions among developers over future upgrades for the Ethereum blockchain. Coinbase aims to provide a “trusted interface, curated experiences” to people who previously have not spent a lot of time working with blockchains. Coinbase, the big publicly traded U.S. crypto exchange, is preparing for the launch of its new Base blockchain on Wednesday, expected around noon ET (9 am Pacific time). The new network, technically a “layer 2” blockchain built atop Ethereum, is expected to immediately vault into the top ranks of rival projects. Even prior to its official public debut, there was already $133 million of deposits locked into apps and protocols on the new Base network, according to the crypto analysis firm Dune. That amount of “total value locked” or TVL – a common metric for evaluating blockchains and protocols – is enough to rank Base as the fifth-biggest layer-2 blockchain. On Tuesday, CoinDesk had a zoom conversation with Jesse Pollak, creator of Base and head of protocols at Coinbase, about the new blockchain's strategy, revenue potential and regulatory considerations. A key point that Pollak emphasized: No publicly traded company has ever launched its own blockchain, so “there’s no playbook” for how to go about it. The following Q&A has been edited for clarity and brevity. CoinDesk: What does Coinbase get out of this initiative? Pollak: Coinbase was started in 2012, before Ethereum, before smart contracts. It was really just a place to buy and sell bitcoin. And then over the last decade, it's expanded, you know, adding more currencies, made it so you couldn’t just buy and sell, you could also save, you could stake, you borrow, you could lend. I think the kind of guiding North Star for Coinbase has been like, How do we enable people to safely and easily do things with crypto? That's it. And I think historically that the aperture of what people can do with crypto has been relatively limited, right? It's been mostly speculation, and mostly\",\n",
              "  '(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin may be closer to bursting out of a period of unusually low volatility if chart patterns and the token’s history are any guide. Most Read from Bloomberg Everyone Wants to Work at UPS After Teamsters Deal WeWork Tumbles After Raising ‘Substantial Doubt’ About Future US Bank Shares Drop as Moody’s Cuts Ratings, Warns on Risks Wall Street WhatsApp, Texting Fines Exceed $2.5 Billion Tesla CFO Kirkhorn Exits With $590 Million Fortune Some gauges of how much the largest digital asset swings around dropped toward a record low in the past month as Bitcoin hovered around $30,000. The lull coincided with a cooling in the token’s 2023 rebound from last year’s rout. The year-to-date gain stands at 80%, down from 90% through mid-July. Potential catalysts for a breakout include pending applications from firms like BlackRock Inc. to start the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US, which could stoke demand. On the flip side, investors remain alert to the risks exposed by the 2022 crypto crash. The spotlight most recently has fallen on the health of the Huobi exchange linked to crypto mogul Justin Sun. “An approaching ETF verdict may disrupt the slow phase of the market of late,” Bendik Schei and Vetle Lunde of K33 Research wrote in a note, flagging Aug. 13 as one of the deadlines for a Securities and Exchange Commission response to an ARK Investment Management LLC application. “Whether the SEC postpones, rejects or approves ARK’s filing could ignite volatility in the market.” Bitcoin retreated about 1% to $29,725 as of 8:05 a.m. in London on Wednesday. Smaller virtual currencies such as Ether and Cardano also struggled for traction. Key charts below provide hints on Bitcoin’s volatility outlook. Repeat Pattern Bitcoin has traced a falling wedge — a narrowing price range — that resembles a pattern that presaged a June rally. Chart analysts often view a falling wedge as bullish.

              "  'Bitcoin\\'s (BTC) \"taker buy-sell ratio\" recently surged on several crypto exchanges, signaling a renewed bullish sentiment around $29,000. The ratio surged to 1.36 on Aug. 1 on ByBit, reaching the highest in at least a year, according to data tracked by South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant. Values above 1 indicate that takers\\' buy volume is outpacing the sell volume, a sign of bullish trading in the market. ByBit is the world\\'s third largest crypto perpetual futures exchange as per open interest and trading volume. The ratio hit a three-and-a-half-month high of 1.17 on BitMEX on Tuesday and a six-month high of 1.31 on OKX on July 30. The taker buy-sell ratio is the ratio of buy volume divided by the sell volume of takers in perpetual swap markets. Perpetual swaps are futures-like derivative contracts with no expiry, allowing traders to speculate on the value of the underlying asset. Market takers are entities that put orders to buy or sell securities immediately, taking out liquidity from the order book. Trading firms, individual investors fall into the category of takers. Meanwhile, entities in the business of creating order book liquidity are market makers. The data explains the recent bear failure to keep bitcoin below $29,000. Since July, bitcoin has chalked out multiple daily candles with long lower wicks, indicating brief periods of sub-$29,000 trading. Prices jumped over 2% on Tuesday, topping the $30,000 mark for the first time. According to CryptoQuant\\'s CEO Ki Young Ju, a spike in taker buy-sell ratio on low-volume exchanges like BitMEX is often a sign of increased buying by whales or large investors. \"Bitcoin whales opened giga longs at $29,000,\" Ju tweeted Tuesday, referring the taker buy-sell ratio.',\n",
              "  'With the launch of a new program focused on crypto assets and blockchain technology, the United States Federal Reserve is broadening its influence on crypto beyond monetary policy. On Aug. 8, the central bank unveiled plans to “supervise novel activities in the banks it oversees.” These activities include “technology-driven partnerships with non-banks to provide banking services,” providing custody, trading, or collateralized lending services for crypto assets, and tokenizing securities, according to a document detailing the program. As the crypto industry has grown in influence and value, it has become increasingly intertwined with the traditional banking system, which the Fed regulates and supervises. With today’s announcement, the agency is acknowledging the impact of crypto, though it’s not yet clear whether the program will buoy or hinder the industry’s push toward broad adoption. The Fed also detailed a “supervisory nonobjection process for state member banks seeking to engage in certain activities involving tokens denominated in national currencies and issued using distributed ledger technology.” The process involves a bank notifying the Fed with a description of its proposed activity, addressing risks of all types, including operational, cybersecurity, liquidity and illicit finance risks. After receiving the notification, the Fed will, in essence, either approve or prohibit the proposed activity. The agency said the letter builds on a policy statement issued in January which said that uninsured and insured banks would be subject to the same limitations on activities, including crypto-asset-related activities. Crypto participants took to social media to debate whether the Fed’s announcement is a boon or a curse for the industry, or a bit of both depending on the specific project or token in question. Nic Carter, a well-known investor who penned an influential article on the Biden Administration’s crackdown on the crypto industry, sees the Fed’s announcement as a bearish indicator. “[The Fed] want[s] to discourage innovation/risk-taking, suppress fintechs that are gaining market share by banking riskier clients, and create barriers to entry to consolidate the industry,” he said. Carter also interprets the Fed’s position on banks’ issuance of stablecoins as rendering the use of public blockchains to distribute the tokens impossible.',\n",

See related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin plunges under US$30,000 amid market turbulence. Is US$27,000 next?\\xa0 Bitcoin was little changed during afternoon trading in Asia, trading at US$29,779 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong after it fell below the US$30,000 support level on July 24. “Recent data reveals that a staggering 69.2% of the total Bitcoin supply has remained untouched for over a year. This trend showcases a robust belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value, even amidst the notorious downturns that have characterized the cryptocurrency market over the past year,” according to a Bitfinex research report, shared with Forkast. “With a significant chunk of Bitcoin’s supply remaining inactive, the available supply in the market diminishes. This inherent scarcity, juxtaposed with burgeoning demand, has the potential to drive prices upward. The unwavering faith in Bitcoin paints a bullish picture for the cryptocurrency’s future.” Lifted by Bitcoin, Ether rose 0.26% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,860 from US$1,869 earlier today.

Bitcoin (BTC) is beginning the Asia trading day at $29,786, up 2% on-day, while ether (ETH) is trading at $1,855, up 1.3%. Bitcoin’s volatility continues to be at a record low, Vivien Fang, head of trading products at Bybit, said in a note to CoinDesk, suggesting an eventual rebound. “Our attention is on catalysts toward year-end, potentially linked to ETF narratives or industry-transforming events,” she said. “The alignment between speculative strategies and these kinds of pivotal events could combine to form significant tailwinds for the crypto market.” The 30k mark is a critical threshold, with consensus indicating 40k as the next significant level, Fang explained. However, there remains a high potential for a volatility surge due to macro-related downside events that could unexpectedly impact the market. Despite bitcoin’s low volatility, it’s still outperformed crypto hedge funds, according to a report from 21e6 Capital. “It is plain to see that a simple buy-and-hold investment into bitcoin would have outperformed all of these fund baskets. Bitcoin added about 80% in value by the half of the year,” 21e6 Capital due diligence manager Jan Spörer and sales and marketing head Maximilian Bruckner wrote in the report. “In previous bull runs, crypto hedge funds were frequently able to significantly outperform the bitcoin benchmark.” Data from CryptoRank.io shows that the price of bitcoin and the amount of money invested in crypto startups have historically been correlated, their analyst team wrote in a note to CoinDesk. In 2022, both were on the decline. However, despite the significant growth of bitcoin in 2023, the monthly amount raised is low compared to 2021-2022.

              " 'Dogecoin': ['Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s attorneys argued on Monday that the billionaire’s legal battle with a group of disgruntled Dogecoin investors has dragged on for too long. Musk’s counsel asked for the plaintiff’s revised complaint to be dismissed, according to a filing submitted in a New York federal court. In a letter supporting the dismissal, Musk lawyer Alex Shapiro skewered the lawsuit’s latest complaint submitted on behalf of Dogecoin investors. “Enough is enough,” Shapiro wrote. “This action is yet another example of counsel’s abusive and belligerent litigation tactics.” Evan Spencer, the lead attorney in the class-action lawsuit against Musk, amended the lawsuit’s complaint for a third time in June, tacking on additional allegations. Elon Musk, Tesla and SpaceX Hit With $258 Billion Dogecoin Lawsuit The lawsuit, which initially sought $258 billion in damages when filed last June, accuses Musk of “a deliberate course of carnival barking, market manipulation, and insider trading” when it comes to one of crypto’s most iconic meme coins. Musk’s enthusiasm for Dogecoin has been well-documented over the years since his initial Tweet that “Dogecoin may be [his] fav cryptocurrency” in April 2019, and it’s only continued since his acquisition of Twitter last year. The Tesla CEO’s latest high-profile moment involving Dogecoin took place around (but not on) April Fools Day when Twitter’s logo was temporarily replaced with Dogecoin’s Shiba Inu mascot. In the amended complaint, Spenser notes the switch took place shortly after Musk’s counsel sought to dismiss the lawsuit in March and led Dogecoin to rally 30%.  Dogecoin Surges 20% as Doge Replaces Bird Logo on Twitter In 2021, Dogecoin pumped to dizzying heights ahead of Musk’s appearance on NBC’s Saturday Night Live only for Dogecoin to buckle after he called it a hustle on the late-night comedy show. Still, Musk’s counsel says any Dogecoin “cheerleading” their client has done over the years amounts to “quintessential, inactionable puffery.” “There is nothing unlawful about tweeting words of support for, or funny pictures about, a cryptocurrency,” Musk’s counsel wrote in Monday’s motion, deriding the amended complaint as “fanciful, meandering, and often incomprehensible.” Musk’s lawyers stated the lawsuit’s',\n",

In fact, cryptos that aren’t Bitcoin are usually considered an “also ran” – what are called “altcoins,” or alternatives to Bitcoin.

              " 'Ethereum': [\"Stockholm, August 9th, 2023 - Virtune, a Swedish regulated digital asset manager in Sweden is launching a new innovative staking ETP on Nasdaq Stockholm, the largest stock exchange in the Nordic region. Today, Virtune is announcing the introduction of Virtune Staked Ethereum ETP SEK, providing exposure to Ethereum combined with the benefits of staking.  The ETP which is 100% physically backed and fully collateralized is denominated in SEK for the Swedish audience and is available on Avanza and Nordnet. By including staking, this ETP provides investors with up to 5% in additional annual return on their ETP Ethereum investment.  Ethereum is currently the second largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of about $219 billion and the world's leading smart contract platform which can revolutionize the way we interact with technology and finance. With its robust ecosystem, Ethereum enables developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) that can reshape industries, eliminate middlemen, and bring greater transparency and efficiency to global systems. By engaging in Ethereum staking, you actively support the blockchain network and promote its decentralized nature.  This product caters to institutional investors as well as retail investors, serving the many people who support Ethereum already to improve and enhance their Ethereum investment even further. Virtune uses non-custodial staking meaning that the assets are being staked directly from cold storage, therefore there is no need to transfer the asset to any third party which is associated with risk.  Key Information about the product: 1:1 exposure to Ethereum combined with staking providing up to 5% additional annual return 100% physically backed Non-custodial staking 1.40% annual management fee Virtune Staked Ethereum ETP SEK: Full name: Virtune Staked Ethereum ETP SEK Short name: Virtune Staked Ethereum SEK Trading currency: SEK First day of trading: Wednesday 9th of August Ticker: VIRSETHS ISIN: SE0020541639 Christopher Kock, CEO of Virtune:\\xa0“We are very happy to introduce a 100% physically backed Ethereum product integrated with staking.

              "  \"Coinbase expects to get more revenue from decentralized applications or “dapps” that build atop Base than from the blockchain itself. Coinbase has participated in discussions among developers over future upgrades for the Ethereum blockchain. Coinbase aims to provide a “trusted interface, curated experiences” to people who previously have not spent a lot of time working with blockchains. Coinbase, the big publicly traded U.S. crypto exchange, is preparing for the launch of its new Base blockchain on Wednesday, expected around noon ET (9 am Pacific time). The new network, technically a “layer 2” blockchain built atop Ethereum, is expected to immediately vault into the top ranks of rival projects. Even prior to its official public debut, there was already $133 million of deposits locked into apps and protocols on the new Base network, according to the crypto analysis firm Dune. That amount of “total value locked” or TVL – a common metric for evaluating blockchains and protocols – is enough to rank Base as the fifth-biggest layer-2 blockchain. On Tuesday, CoinDesk had a zoom conversation with Jesse Pollak, creator of Base and head of protocols at Coinbase, about the new blockchain's strategy, revenue potential and regulatory considerations. A key point that Pollak emphasized: No publicly traded company has ever launched its own blockchain, so “there’s no playbook” for how to go about it. The following Q&A has been edited for clarity and brevity. CoinDesk: What does Coinbase get out of this initiative? Pollak: Coinbase was started in 2012, before Ethereum, before smart contracts. It was really just a place to buy and sell bitcoin. And then over the last decade, it's expanded, you know, adding more currencies, made it so you couldn’t just buy and sell, you could also save, you could stake, you borrow, you could lend. I think the kind of guiding North Star for Coinbase has been like, How do we enable people to safely and easily do things with crypto? That's it. And I think historically that the aperture of what people can do with crypto has been relatively limited, right? It's been mostly speculation, and mostly\",\n",

Saddle’s founder Sunil Srivatsa on Tuesday proposed the group liquidate its treasury into Arbitrum (ARB) tokens and airdrop the proceeds to holders of Saddle’s SDL and veSDL tokens, with veSDL holders getting four times as big an allocation. It was not immediately clear how large Saddle’s treasury was. The snap poll comes after the monumental hack of decentralized exchange (DEX) giant Curve last month, which ripped through Ethereum's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and, according to Srivatsa’s blog post, reminded Saddle’s team of the ever-present threat of exploitable bugs. Saddle Finance offers a similar feature set to Curve and previously faced allegations of cloning Curve's codebase. Srivatsa said the protocol’s developers need to step back from the project by September 30, 2023. Saddle previously raised over $10 million from venture backers. The platform, which is used to exchange between stablecoins and other like-kind assets, currently has around $2 million worth of user deposits according to analytics on its website. The snapshot for determining who is eligible for allocations has already happened, according to investors watching the situation. Srivatsa did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

              "  'Exploiting DeFi protocols has long become crypto’s most popular type of crime, while traditional exchange hacks have become far less frequent. But cybercriminals haven’t lost all interest in the good old digital robbery. The recent hack of a crypto payment processor CoinsPaid shows that the most industrious cybercriminal groups in the world are still willing to spend formidable resources on breaking into centralized entities. CoinsPaid, a Ukrainian firm registered in Estonia, reported being hacked on July 22, with estimated crypto losses of $37.3 million. According to the CEO Max Krupyshev, the company ended up refunding clients from its own funds. Those customers likely include online casinos, which according to a Blockchain Intelligence Group, are widespread users of CoinsPaid. In a detailed explanation of the incident published Monday, CoinsPaid said that, judging by the thieves’ on-chain behavior, they were very likely the North Korean Lazarus Group or affiliated with it. To siphon money out of CoinsPaid, the attackers used wallets that included the one spotted in another recent attack attributed to Lazarus – the Atomic Wallet hack in June, Blockchain Intelligence Group wrote. The attackers had been targeting CoinsPaid for months before finally pulling off the theft, CoinsPaid said. Fishing and social engineering attempts started in March, including a request from someone posing as a fellow Ukrainian crypto processing startup, who was asking CoinsPaid developers about the firm’s technical infrastructure, the blog post said. The attackers also tried to bribe CoinsPaid staff and engaged in distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks aimed at the company’s servers. Then, in July, several employees received lucrative job offerings from LinkedIn accounts posing as recruiters from other crypto companies, including the exchange Crypto.com. “For instance, some of our team members received job offers with compensation ranging from 16,000-24,000 USD a month,” the blog post said. After making an initial contact, the fake recruiters asked the employees to install JumpCloud, a platform for user authentication that was reportedly also hacked by Lazarus in July, or other software, presumably to perform a test task.

              "  'London, United Kingdom --News Direct-- Chainwire Ramp Network, a financial technology company building payment rails connecting crypto to the global financial system has added support for Base, the Coinbase-developed layer2 network. The integration means that Ramp users can convert Base-native ETH and USDC to crypto on other chains as well as into fiat currency. Designed to support fast and low-cost transactions, Base is an Ethereum L2 that’s built using Optimism’s rollup technology. In late July the network opened its mainnet to developers, followed by an official launch on August 9. Base has already witnessed an influx of users seeking to access the new tokens and DeFi primitives emerging on the layer2 chain. Ramp’s decision to add support for Base creates a valuable pipeline for entering and exiting the Base ecosystem, making it easier for users to direct digital assets to where they’re needed. “Coinbase’s fresh blockchain, Base, was initially introduced to developers in February. Nevertheless, its formal public debut is today. In alignment with our steadfast commitment to the ecosystem’s Layer 2 solutions, Ramp will proudly support Base right from its inception, enabling transactions with ETH and USDC from day one. Exciting times ahead!” stated Szymon Sypniewicz, CEO of Ramp. Developing reliable on- and off-ramps is critical to bootstrapping emerging crypto networks. Ramp’s integration of Base arrives at a crucial time for the nascent chain, giving users the confidence to explore the L2 confidence that they can withdraw funds whenever they like. The Ramp platform now supports the conversion of ETH and USDC on Base into dozens of other crypto assets including BTC, stablecoins, and ETH on other chains. In addition, users can convert Base assets directly into fiat currency. Ramp can also be used to deposit funds onto Base, allowing users to start exploring its growing ecosystem in minutes. In addition to directly benefiting users of the Coinbase-supported chain, Ramp’s integration of Base will aid third-party developers. It will empower them to create applications that integrate Ramp’s fiat-crypto service. This will accelerate the creation of novel apps that capitalize on the powerful network effects afforded by the new layer2.',\n",

This trend showcases a robust belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value, even amidst the notorious downturns that have characterized the cryptocurrency market over the past year,” according to a Bitfinex research report, shared with Forkast. “With a significant chunk of Bitcoin’s supply remaining inactive, the available supply in the market diminishes. This inherent scarcity, juxtaposed with burgeoning demand, has the potential to drive prices upward.

I’ve asked it at conferences, on live panels, on podcasts, and to smart friends over zoom. It’s pretty simple: “If you couldn’t get rich off of it, what currently existing products in crypto would significant numbers of people still use?” Let me break that down. I use Uber, Google Docs, Twitter, Gmail, Spotify, Netflix, PayPal, Calendly, Slack and\\xa0 iTunes at least once a week, if not every day. And in the case of Gmail and Twitter (I refuse to call it X), I use them pretty much every hour. I use all of these products without any expectation of becoming a millionaire.

              "  \"Detroit, Michigan --News Direct-- Benzinga By James Wells, Benzinga Learn more about and invest in Swopblock via Wefunder. The value of Bitcoin has been rising significantly, experiencing an increase of over 70% since the start of 2023. Alongside this, there have been notable industry developments, such as BlackRock's Spot BTC ETF filing and Ripple's (XRP) victory over the SEC. All of these factors suggest a promising future for altcoins heading into 2024. Amidst these developments, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have gained prominence, especially following the 2022 FTX collapse and several ensuing insolvencies. Swopblock, a new entrant in this critical crypto market sub-sector, is positioning itself as a pioneering player, aiming to emerge as the world’s first 100% decentralized cross-chain exchange platform. The following article will explore the mechanics of Swopblock and its potential significance to investors who prioritize decentralization, the crypto industry's cornerstone principle. Swopblock is an open-source, proof-of-relay (PoR) protocol facilitating peer-to-peer self-custodial cross-chain trading. Users transact directly from their wallets without giving their crypto keys or assets to intermediaries at any phase of trading. Swopblock's protocol, notable for being fully decentralized, distributes 100% of its trading liquidity across all user wallets. Swopblock’s 'Liquidity Stream' powers the network, functioning as the exchange medium driving market volume. SWOBL is the native asset of the Swopblock ecosystem. It serves as a free-flowing medium of exchange that provides the market volume equilibrium necessary for autonomous cross-blockchain trading between peers. Swopblock is powered entirely by SWOBL, embodying 100% of the liquidity across user wallets. As SWOBL serves as a liquidity adapter for various blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin, its demand hinges on the trading volume in the Liquidity Stream. As adoption escalates, SWOBL demand increases. This allows traders, investors and holders of SWOBL (including Swopblock) to potentially capitalize on these gains. The crypto market's decentralized exchange (DEX) sector is heavily populated, with numerous DEXs operating independently on distinct blockchains. Despite the surge in DEX popularity following the 2022 FTX collapse, complete decentralization remains elusive for cross-blockchain DEXs. Here are several reasons why these DEXs fall short of achieving complete decentralization: Centralized Elements: Liquidity pools,\",\n",

Ethereum also has been at the forefront of the altseason, outperforming Bitcoin. In the last 24 hours, the transaction volume of Ethereum has spiked by 85%, signaling even more gains. Now trading at $1,867, the price of Ethereum has been forecasted to top $2,000 in August. Since its partial victory against the SEC, Ripple (XRP) has been one of crypto's top performers. The price of XRP jumped by more than 70% to top $0.85 for the first time in 15 months. In the last 30 days, Ripple maintains 46.5% of its gains. In addition, the network activity on the XRP Ledger has been on the rise in the last three weeks. The Republic of Palau is developing its stablecoin on the XRP Ledger. In addition, Hong Kong-based Fubon Bank will also test the tokenization of real estate programs on the blockchain. With these increased activities, crypto experts have predicted even more price increases for Ripple. Now trading at $0.7048, the price of Ripple is forecasted to overcome the $1 barrier in the third quarter. While Ethereum and XRP are set up for significant gains, some have predicted explosive growth\",\n",
              "  'The CoinDesk Market Index of 183 assets – a broad-based indicator of crypto market sentiment – is down 1.4% for the last week. But that is just a blip in its 60.1% growth year to date. Let’s take a look at the bigger picture of the top-10 and bottom-10 assets based on their performance month on month. Culture and entertainment assets and currencies predominated the leaders. Small gaming and metaverse protocols including Yield Guild Games (YGG), a global community that bands gamers together to play, and HighStreet (HIGH), a decentralized metaverse and massively multiplayer online role-playing game, as well as LivePeer (LPT), a decentralized video streaming network protocol, made a huge impression in the top 10 leaderboard. But their impact overall was not so large. As these are all small players, the culture and entertainment sector, which is market-cap weighted, was pretty flat month on month (down 0.4%). The spectacular up and down of Yield Guild Games is a story still in progress. On Aug. 3, the guild announced the launch of its fourth audience-building campaign that features numerous quests and rewards. The token rose a dizzying 600% over the next four days, but on Aug. 7 began to plummet as rumors that the guild’s initial backers were using the opportunity to take their money out. “It appears to be a pump and dump,” said CoinDesk Indices Data Analyst Reilly Decker. Stellar (XLM), XRP (XRP) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) were the biggest currency leaders over the last week. Stellar is building on a research report it released in July that supports the narrative that XLM is one of the most well-connected and integrated USDC cash off-ramps. XRP is still benefiting from a U.S. judge’s ruling last month that the sale of XRP tokens on exchanges do not constitute investment contracts (and therefore are not covered by securities laws). Just this month, Shiba Inu (SHIB) announced it would tie digital identity services across all of its platforms, another sign of its effort to distance itself from its meme coin origins and become a serious DeFi protocol. Recently, a shiba inu investor',\n",

              "  \"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening: Prices: Regulatory clarity is required for bitcoin to push past $30,000. Insights: Where is the utility in Web3? Bitcoin (BTC) is beginning the Asia trading day at $29,786, up 2% on-day, while ether (ETH) is trading at $1,855, up 1.3%. Bitcoin’s volatility continues to be at a record low, Vivien Fang, head of trading products at Bybit, said in a note to CoinDesk, suggesting an eventual rebound. “Our attention is on catalysts toward year-end, potentially linked to ETF narratives or industry-transforming events,” she said. “The alignment between speculative strategies and these kinds of pivotal events could combine to form significant tailwinds for the crypto market.” The 30k mark is a critical threshold, with consensus indicating 40k as the next significant level, Fang explained. However, there remains a high potential for a volatility surge due to macro-related downside events that could unexpectedly impact the market. Despite bitcoin’s low volatility, it’s still outperformed crypto hedge funds, according to a report from 21e6 Capital. “It is plain to see that a simple buy-and-hold investment into bitcoin would have outperformed all of these fund baskets. Bitcoin added about 80% in value by the half of the year,” 21e6 Capital due diligence manager Jan Spörer and sales and marketing head Maximilian Bruckner wrote in the report. “In previous bull runs, crypto hedge funds were frequently able to significantly outperform the bitcoin benchmark.” Data from CryptoRank.io shows that the price of bitcoin and the amount of money invested in crypto startups have historically been correlated, their analyst team wrote in a note to CoinDesk. In 2022, both were on the decline. However, despite the significant growth of bitcoin in 2023, the monthly amount raised is low compared to 2021-2022. The question continues to be: what will cause the next breakout? And what if it's not the long-awaited bitcoin ETF? Crypto Market Leaders and Laggards: The Biggest Movers of the Week: Stellar, XRP and Shiba Inu were notable winners from the last week, while Curve Finance and Augur struggled. The market is down overall, according to CoinDesk Market Index, but only marginally\",\n",

              "  'Bitcoin gets all the headlines when people talk about cryptocurrencies, but there are literally thousands of other options when it comes to these digital currencies. In fact, cryptos that aren’t Bitcoin are usually considered an “also ran” – what are called “altcoins,” or alternatives to Bitcoin. While Bitcoin may have been the first major cryptocurrency to hit the market – it debuted in 2009 – many others have become highly popular, even if not quite as large as the original. Here are the largest cryptocurrencies by the total dollar value of the coins in existence, that is, the market capitalization, or market cap. (Data is from CoinMarketCap.com, as of August 9, 2023.) Price: $29,717 Market cap: $578 billion As the harbinger of the cryptocurrency era, Bitcoin is still the coin people generally reference when they talk about digital currency. Its mysterious creator — allegedly Satoshi Nakamoto — debuted the currency in 2009 and it’s been on a roller-coaster ride since then. However, it wasn’t until 2017 that the cryptocurrency broke into popular consciousness. Price: $1,852 Market cap: $223 billion Ethereum — the name for the cryptocurrency platform — is the second name you’re most likely to recognize in the crypto space. The system allows you to use ether (the currency) to perform a number of functions, but the smart contract aspect of Ethereum helps make it a popular currency. Price: $1.00 Market cap: $83 billion Tether’s price is anchored at $1 per coin. That’s because it is what’s called a stablecoin. Stablecoins are tied to the value of a specific asset, in Tether’s case, the U.S. Dollar. Tether often acts as a medium when traders move from one cryptocurrency to another. Rather than move back to dollars, they use Tether. However, some people are concerned that Tether isn’t safely backed by dollars held in reserve but instead uses a short-term form of unsecured debt. Price: $244.83 Market cap: $38 billion BNB is the cryptocurrency issued by Binance, among the largest crypto exchanges in the world.
